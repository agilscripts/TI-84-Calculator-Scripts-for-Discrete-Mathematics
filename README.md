# TI-84: Discrete Mathematics 

If you've ever wanted to push your TI-84 calculator beyond its basic functions, you're in the right place. I've put together this collection of scripts along with many custom written ones.

## Scripts Tailored for Discrete Mathematics
- **RSA Cryptography Suite**: For those exploring cryptography in your discrete math course, `RSAD` validates your RSA setup, while `RSAENCRY` and `RSADECRY` introduce practical encryption and decryption exercises. Perfect for understanding the backbone of digital security.
- **Probability and Combinatorics**: Unveil the secrets of probability with `FLIPFIRS` and `at leastH`. These tools are fantastic for assignments on random variables, counting techniques, and exploring the binomial theorem's applications.
- **Number Theory**: With `LINEAR` (Extended Euclidean Algorithm) and `FASTEXPO` (Modular Exponentiation), tackle the foundational elements of number theory directly on your calculator. Ideal for students and educators dealing with prime numbers, congruences, and modular arithmetic.
- **Numeral Systems Made Easy**: `ABSconvrt` seamlessly converts between binary, hex, and decimal, demystifying numeral systems for anyone in discrete mathematics. 
- **Deep Dives into Advanced Topics**: Enhance your grasp of Bayes' theorem with `Bayesthe`, or explore conditional probabilities with `CONPROBA`. These scripts are designed to simplify complex topics, making them accessible for both teaching and learning.
